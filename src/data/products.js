  'description': 'Pellets for grilling, smoking, barbecue - pellets made from linden and oak wood. Wood pellets are 100% pressed sawdust for smoking from high-quality linden (70%) and oak (30%) peeled from bark, ash content no more than 0.4%. Linden-oak pellets for smoking are universal and perfectly complement the taste of a wide variety of meat, fish, poultry and cheese dishes, ideal for lamb and venison. For pellet grills such as Weber, Oklahoma Joes, Broil King and pellet pizza ovens, pellets are the only possible fuel. Our granules meet all the requirements of grill manufacturers and serve perfectly as fuel. Also great for barbecues and smokehouses of all types: hot smoker, cold smoker and fish smoker. When grilling or grilling, pellets scatter on top of the hot coals. As the granules smolder, they begin to produce abundant smoke, which will give the dish a smoky effect and a pleasant taste and honey-floral aroma. When cooking in smokers, pellets can replace wood chips, just place the pellets in the smoker instead of wood chips. The consumption of granules is two times less than wood chips. The composition does not contain any binders, dyes or flavors. Wood pellets for smoking are fully consistent with premium quality and are superior to foreign analogues in efficiency and environmental friendliness; they ideally fulfill their task, making any food more flavorful and appetizing. Supplied in a sealed plastic bag, which preserves the properties of the granules for a long time. Much more economical and efficient than regular smokehouse wood chips.',

  'description': 'Cyclamens of the F1 Helios series are the creation of the famous breeder Charles Morel. Fringed, large-flowered, abundantly flowering plants, forming a luxurious “bouquet” above a mantle of painted leaves. Each flower lasts on the plant for up to three weeks. Recommended flowering time in our area is from October to March. Plants develop very quickly and enter the decorative period 2-3 weeks earlier than other large-flowered varieties. Cyclamen seeds are slow to germinate and it takes 1 to 3 months for seedlings to appear. The best result of pre-sowing seed treatment is obtained by contrasting heat treatment: the seeds are placed for 2 seconds. into hot (90-95 °C) water, then for 2 seconds. when cold, the operation is repeated twice, and then sown in pots with leaf and peat soil (1:1). The seeds are sprinkled with a 0.5-1.0 cm layer of soil on top, watered abundantly, and covered with a dark film. At t=20?C, seedlings appear in 30-40 days. After the emergence of seedlings, the shading is removed and the temperature is reduced to 15-17? C. When small nodules with two leaves form, dive into boxes with a mixture of leaf, peat soil and sand (2: 1: 0.5). When transplanting young plants, the top of the nodule should be at the very surface of the soil (no deeper than 0.5 cm). In mature plants, the top of the tuber is usually open. During the dormant period it sheds its leaves. They are grown in northern and eastern windows; in southern windows they are shaded from direct sunlight. In winter, keep in a bright place at a temperature no higher than 8 - 10? C. In summer, it is necessary to follow techniques to support plant growth: water exclusively through a tray, spray with water at room temperature, fertilize (no more than 2-3 times per summer) mainly with nitrogen-potassium fertilizers.',
